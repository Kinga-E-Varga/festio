# Current Feature: RSVP form fixes

## Status

Completed

## Goals

- Coming / Not coming buttons move to the top of the form, above the names.
- One warning slot above Send, only after a Send attempt, first problem only, top to bottom: no choice picked → empty name → missing age → missing dietary needs → Other picked with no words. Live once attempted.
- When Coming is picked, each name gets two required questions: **Age** (radios: Adult / Child / Baby) and **Dietary needs** (checkboxes: None, Vegetarian, Vegan, Gluten-free, Lactose-free, Nut allergy, Other; None and needs clear each other; Other opens a text box the guest must fill in). Not coming → neither asked.
- Same options and rules as the host's reply editor; reuse its types and option lists.
- Custom radios and checkboxes — no browser default look, every colour from the invitation palette (`--c` vars); focus ring in `--c3`.
- In the invitation editor the form works fully; a passing reply shows the toast "Nothing saved — this is a test" (host's language), then the thank-you. The editor never saves.
- New texts in EN / RO / HU — guest-facing in `Rsvp`, the toast in `HostEditor`.

## Notes

- Spec: `context/fixes/rsvp-form.md`.
- Payload: `RsvpAttendee` gets `ageGroup`, `diet` (empty = None), `dietOther`, shaped like `GuestReply`. Not coming = keys left out. No storage.
- Radios/checkboxes may change to chips or a dropdown after seeing it.

## History

<!-- Keep this updated latest to earliest -->

- Invitation editor tabs — the dashboard Invitations page archived to `archived/invitations-page/`; Edit invitation and Print straight from the events list, BACK falling back to it; a new event row layout with shared action blocks and short month names; no Studio in the nav, Downloads in Hosting; the editor panel's Text / Response / Design tabs with the X as a segment, sticky at the top, with a hint on where the reply message shows and the View button in `--c2`
- Prettier formatting — one pinned style (double quotes, semicolons) in `.prettierrc.json`, `npm run format` / `format:check`, VS Code format-on-save with Prettier, a Claude Code hook that formats every file Claude edits, and a one-time reformat of the codebase
- Card shadow, tab hover, Active = shared — a template sets its card shadow (light / dark / none) and the stage leaves room for it, so the card no longer pads itself; lighter tab hover with a bottom border and a 3px tab border; Active holds only paid Public / Protected events, with the status worked out instead of stored and the Active / Draft texts fixed in EN, RO and HU
- Simplify codebase — a quality-only cleanup of all of `src/`, one chunk at a time, with a plain-language review and a possible-bugs list in `context/reviews/2026-09-29.md`
- Event package — one Free / Standard / Custom package in place of tier + invitation type, named package everywhere (HU csomag, RO pachet); Custom unlocks every template; package texts restored in the edit page; event row actions reordered with shorter HU/RO edit labels
- Reply editor — edit a reply with every RSVP question (age, diet with None/Other, the host's questions, reply-wide answers with Separate from group); New reply with several people; unsaved-changes guards shared with the list box and a leave-page warning; custom answers and the message in the reply details; keyboard diet dropdown
- Preloaded guest list — the list box as a draft editor: paste and add names, an A→Z list with a sticky search, × for waiting names and "replied" for the rest, Save / Cancel with unadded-names and discard prompts; opens above the list buttons, fades in and out; one shared gold button colour
- Guest summary — the guest list page's Summary: Replies, Age and Dietary needs tables, custom question answers and messages behind a Show/Hide toggle, an Other diet option, and mock custom questions on the engagement
- Guest list row design — one sheet with category sections, reply threads, a Needs your attention section for unknown and identical names, foldable reply details, a header that gives up space in order, and Summary / Guest list page sections
- React Grab — dev-only tool to copy an element's component and file location for Claude Code
- Event guest list — one page per event with the merged list, categories, Unknown/Duplicate resolving, inline editing, pasted names and invite-sent tracking; BACK falls back to each page's own list
- Safety features — clean slug-only links, the Protected password on the printed card, expected guests with a hidden reply cap, reply-form closing, and one set of warning texts for banners and the notifications rail
- Language / i18n — Romanian and Hungarian for the host app and guest invitations, each invitation with its own language
- Invitation print page — a flat or folded printable at `/prints`, with its own settings form
- Host action bar — one bar over the card: back, edit toggle, save, dismiss
- Invitations page — grid of invitation cards, plus one-record arrivals from Events and the dashboard
- Dashboard & events UX fixes — header action, card restack, warning-only tags
- Dashboard design fixes — stats, card/list layout, editor banners, focus rings
- Invitation composition — card + reply in one component, one tree per panel
- Type 1 invitation page and editing platform
- Events list — "Edit invitation" label + safeguard/dates info
- Scanner fixes — cart badge + safeguard bar helper
- Dashboard events + event edit pages
- Dashboard redesign
- Dashboard UI
- Initial setup
